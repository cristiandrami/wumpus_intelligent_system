Work as GROUPS: choose AT LEAST TWO logic formalisms and design an explicit knowledge base that, given the current information about the environment, entails all the safe UNVISITED positions in the WUMPUS world. If no safe unvisited tiles are available, infer all alternatives.  
* Optional, but strongly suggested: try to take into account some probability/statistics/learning. You can see your agent as a technological master of puppets that remotely guide robots. Once a robot dies, another one can start (always from the same tile, the bottom-left one) but with the whole knowledge from the previous ones.   
DEADLINE: 27/04/2023.
